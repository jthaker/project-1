Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) and Federal Work-Study (FWS) funds reflect federal allocations and do not include the required matching funds from institutions. 2017-18 FSEOG, FWS, tax benefits, state grants, institutional grants, private and employer grants, and nonfederal loans are estimated from earlier data. Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
